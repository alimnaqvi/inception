## Relevant resources and references

Almost all resources mentioned here are official documentation, which is always the best resource to consult to get started as well as to troubleshoot. Third-party resources often have outdated information.

- ["Get started" section](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) of the official Docker docs
  - I recommend going through most of this section before starting the project. The [workshop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/workshop/) is especially useful.
- [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)
- [Docker Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/)
- [Manual for Environment variables in Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/)
- [Manual for Secrets in Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/use-secrets/)
- [MariaDB Server Documentation](https://mariadb.com/docs/server)
